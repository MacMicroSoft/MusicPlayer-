# MusicPlayer

**MusicPlayer** is a simple music player application with basic features. It is created using PyQt5 and relies on QtMultimedia and QtMultimediaWidgets for audio playback. This music player offers convenient functionality for managing your music collection and provides two distinct playlists: a global list for all your music and a favorites list. Additionally, it features a timer that automatically starts when the program launches.

## Features

- **Two Playlists:** MusicPlayer has two playlists: a global list for all your music files and a favorites list. You can add music to your favorites list from the global list.

- **Automatic Storage:** Any music added to the global list is stored in a dictionary called 'music_list' and will be retained even after closing the application.

- **Random Selection:** There is a checkbox labeled "random" that allows you to select music randomly from the global list.
